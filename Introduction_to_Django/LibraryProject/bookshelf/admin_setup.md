# Book Model Admin Setup

1. Registered the Book model with Django admin in `bookshelf/admin.py`.
2. Customized the admin interface:
   - Displayed `title`, `author`, `publication_year` in the list view.
   - Enabled search by `title` and `author`.
   - Added filter by `publication_year`.
3. Access via `/admin` to manage Book entries efficiently.
